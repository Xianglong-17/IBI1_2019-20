This practical is hard but very interesting to finish.
Compared to other practicals, the output of this practical is more directly seen thus produces more fun and sense of accomplishment, especially the third task.
The change of the 2D figure is interesting and I played with it several times. Through this practice, the most important thing I learned is to know how to produce 
a 2D spatial figure. This is a more direct and clear way to present a model like the one of the case.
